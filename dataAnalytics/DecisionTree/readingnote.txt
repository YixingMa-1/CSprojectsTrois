3. classification:
while manual classification often suffices for small and simple data sets with only a few attributes, larger and more complex data sets require an automated solution.

3.1 Basic Concepts:

each such instance is characterized by the tuple(e,y), where x is the set of attribute values that describe the instance and y is the class label of the instance.
the attribute set x can contain attributes of any type, while the class label y must be categorical.

a classification model serves two important roles in data mining. 
1. it is used as a predictive model to classify previously unlabeled instances. 
2. it serves as a descriptive model to identify the characterisitcs that distinguish instances from different classes. 

3.2 General Framework for Classification:
