Introduction to data mining: 1 - 2.1
data mining blends traditional data analysis methods with sophisticated algorithms for processing this abundance of data. 
1.1 what is data mining
the process of automatically discovering useful info in large data repositories. 

data mining and knowledge discovery in databases:
data mining is an intergral part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)

input data => data preprocessing
(feature selection,
dimensionality reduction,
normalization,
data subsetting)
=> data mining => postprocessing
(filtering patterns,
visualization,
pattern interpretation)
=> information

1.2 motivating challenges 
specific challenges that motivated the development of data mining
- scalability
- high dimensionality
- heterogeneous and complex data
- data ownership and distribution 
- non-traditional analysis 

1.3 the origins of data mining 
staticstics, data mining, ai, machine learning, pattern recognition

1.4 data mining tasks
- predictive tasks: 
the objective of these tasks is to predict the value of a paricular attribute based on the values of other attributes

descriptive tasks: 
descriptive data mining tasks are often exploratory in nature and frequently require posprocessing techniques to validate and explain the result

predictive modeling: 
refers to the tasks of building a model for the target variable as a function of the explanatory variables
classification, used for discrete target variables
regression, used for continuous target variables

association analysis:
used to discover patterns that describe strongly association featurein the data 

cluster analysis: find groups of closely related observations so that observations that belong to the same cluster are more similar to each other than observations that belong to other clusters. 

anomaly detection: task of identifying observations whose characteristics are significantly different from the rest of the data. 

1.5 scope and organization of the book

2 data

the type of data: 
quantitative 
qualitative

the quality of the data:
data quality issues that often need to be addressed include the presence of noise and outliers; missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data; and data that is biased or, unrepresentative of the phenomenon or population that the data is supposed to describe. 

preprocessing steps to make the data more suitable for data mining: 
the raw data must be processed in order to make it suitable for analysis. 

analyzing data in terms of its relationships: 

2.1 types of data

a data set can often be viewed as a collection of data objects. 
other names for a data object are record, point, vector, pattern, event, case, sample, instance, observation, entity, case, sample, instance, observation, entity

attribute: an attribute is a property or characteristic of an object that can vary, either from one object to another or from one time to another. 

measurement scale: a rule (function) that associates a numerical or symbolic value with an attribute of an object. 

categorical:
- nominal 
- ordinal 
numerical:
- interval
- ratio
